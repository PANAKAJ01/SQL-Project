## Analyzing Employee Trends
[Analyzing Employee Trends.sql](Analyzing Employee Trends.sql) | [Dataset CSV](Analyzing Employee Trends.csv)

**Project Description:**  
This project involved extensive analysis of HR employee data to uncover insights and trends. The data contained information on employees across departments, including demographics, job roles, satisfaction, attrition, and more.  

I utilized SQL to explore the data and answer key business questions to derive actionable insights.

**Tasks Performed:**  
- Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the HR dataset  
- Wrote SQL queries to analyze employee counts, averages, and distributions across dimensions like department, age, and education  
- Identified top job roles and satisfaction levels by department to understand trends  
- Calculated employee attrition rates by age band to pinpoint high-risk groups  
- Analyzed factors related to attrition like age, education, and job satisfaction  
- Compared averages and aggregates across different employee segments  
- Identified top and bottom performers on key metrics like satisfaction and attrition  
- Used SQL techniques like `JOIN`s, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `CASE` statements for complex analysis  
- Organized and presented findings clearly for leadership consumption

## 2. Exploring Trends in Automotive Industry
[Exploring Trends in Automotive Industry.sql](Exploring Trends in Automotive Industry.sql) | [Dataset CSV](Exploring Trends in Automotive Industry.csv)

**Project Description:**  
This project analyzed a database of car sales information to uncover insights into pricing trends, model performance, and other attributes. The data contained details on car models, pricing history, mileage, transmission types, and more.  

I utilized SQL to explore the data and derive insights to guide pricing, inventory, and marketing strategies.

**Tasks Performed:**  
- Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the cars dataset  
- Analyzed average selling prices by transmission, fuel type, ownership, etc., to reveal pricing patterns  
- Identified highest mileage models to understand durability and maintenance costs  
- Computed price variability within and across models to guide pricing strategy  
- Compared pricing and mileage metrics vs overall averages to find outliers  
- Generated cumulative price trends over time and year-over-year comparisons  
- Computed iterative analytics like moving averages for price smoothing  
- Summarized total mileage by transmission for maintenance planning  
- Ranked models by selling price and analyzed historical averages for top models  
- Used SQL techniques like `WINDOW` functions, `CTE`s, and `JOIN`s for advanced analysis  
- Presented findings in a clear format for stakeholders
